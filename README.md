Exam Randomizer

Currently the goal is to create a simple tool to create randomized versions of exams. For now, it will accept a limited format of excel file as its input (Question, Correct Answer, Wrong 1, Wrong 2, Wrong 3).
Output will include an excel file for each version and an answerkey to match each version. 


Future plans include adding flexibility for users to specify the format of their input files, including having more than 4 options for each question and allowing images to be included in questions and answers. Currently, output files will be an excel file, but I would like to allow for a nicely formatted word document. I'd like to also make a GUI for the application.
